Please note that the following text is considered "for purposes of good-faith security research".

For now some of this information will be further gatekept. 

This write up will absolutly however give you all the access you need to backup and preserve your RingEdge hardware featuring Puyo Puyo !! Quest Arcade. 

Please note that this preservation may apply to other devices, and games in the Ring* family such as RingEdge2, and RingWide. 

Please remember the wise words of Mitsurugi_w "The info itself is not new or special. It's all over the web anyways" 

# Stage Two:

For a long time the details of how Ring* game images are ReKeyed, or NoKeyed has been a closely guarded, and heavily traded 
/ paid for secret. With the first decade of deployment coming to a close, it is also time to close off this "Internet Money Maker". 
As hardware begins to fail, the threat of required preservation looms. 

Please note: You may no longer need to have the *proper* / *original* security key in order to play the cloned drive. Don't be a dick... 
like others before today. Use this to back up your hardware for preservation sake, not for resale purposes! Keep your orignal key chips
on hand. If you sell the drive, sell the key chip with it. Don't sell rekeyed, or nokeyed drives. 

Have fun! Be safe!
